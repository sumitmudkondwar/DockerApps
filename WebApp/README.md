# Dockerise an DotNet Web App

* First we created an dotnet web app MVC where not selected the autogenerated docker file and kept the solution and csproj in same folder.
* Then I added a docker file with the code below

```bash
FROM nginx
COPY ./DockerSampleApp/ /usr/share/nginx/html
```

Now running the command to build the docker image

> docker build -t sample-web-app .

This command will generate the docker image with latest tag.

> docker build -q -t sample-web-app:1.0 .

This Command wil generate the docker image with 1.0 tag

If you want to generate a docker image but donot want to show any logs then use **`-q`** in the command.
